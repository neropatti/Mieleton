So basically I want to parse the entire webpage that I receive, and take note of these meta tags
For normal sites, convert to UTF-8, and then just go through the string XD

What's the best way to find these tags? If I use some built-in methods, I could end up doing useless work where I parse
through the same text multiple times, when the stuff could be done in one pass

String.find() seems to be a suitable candinate, since you can pass in the start of the search into it
So, find the first instance of "<meta" or "<meta property", and then check if it's about something we care :)
Also ig I should check if the tag closes properly or something

Like, somehow I want to avoid user-input on the page from being parsed as these legitimate tags...
Do I have to properly parse the HTML? Eh, kinda cringe. Probably just do a naïve approach for now, and do a proper
one later/when issues arise XD

I could look for some ready-made html parsers I guess..? This kind of seems like a rabbit hole to me

Now, the only site-specific code I would need would be for the archival side. I can always have a naïve thing
that just saves the entire HTML page as text and do nothing else, but that will not include images & video (or external scripts)

For youtube, I obviously want to save the video if archival is attempted.
How do I do this?

Find a working version of youtube-dl and just use that I guess? Or try to make the functionality myself? IDK

Well, I guess I will see after I get the basic rich embeds working XD


Search?
Honestly no idea (maybe ask iFire about search engine stuff..?)

Tags?
Just allow the user to type some tags when saving a link, and highlight matching tags for autocompletion shit

Allow for merging tags, or aliasing them. This should probably be done non-destructively, so the tags just match
each other when searching, but under the hood they are still separate things
